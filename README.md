- ## Hi there 👋

I am Oxana Rosca, a Ph.D. candidate in the Educational Psychology and Methodology Program at the University at Albany – SUNY. I am actively seeking a position as a psychometrician. Currently, I am working on my dissertation in psychometrics, with an expected graduation in spring 2025. I bring over five years of hands-on experience in psychometrics, data analysis, and educational research.

Professional Experience: 
As a Graduate Research Assistant, I have contributed to multiple large-scale assessment projects, gaining deep expertise in test and item analysis using psychometric theories, differential item functioning analyses, and validity studies.

Qualifications. 
Advanced IRT Expertise: My doctoral research involves developing and implementing unidimensional and bifactor IRT models (including GRM and 2PL) on surveys and multistage assessments, both with and without adaptive functions. I perform rigorous item calibration to enhance the accuracy and validity of assessment scores.

Proficiency with Analytical Tools: I am skilled in using RStudio, SPSS, and Mplus for complex data manipulations and analyses. These tools have been instrumental in producing clear, data-driven insights essential for informed decision-making.

Commitment to Educational Measurement and Equity: My research focuses on assessing college readiness and evaluating test validity. In a recent role, I identified potential biases within diagnostic assessments and recommended adjustments that improved both fairness and accuracy in scoring.

Additional Information:
I am eligible for one-year Optional Practical Training (OPT). For longer-term employment, I would require work visa sponsorship.
